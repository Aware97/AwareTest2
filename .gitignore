# ==================== GITIGNORE ====================

# This file tells GitHub: “Don’t upload these files!”

# Think of it as a bouncer at a club - keeps the bad stuff out

# 🔒 SECRET FILES (NEVER UPLOAD!)

.env
.env.local
.env.production
*.key
secrets.json

# 📦 Node Modules (Too big, not needed)

node_modules/
npm-debug.log
yarn-error.log

# 💻 System Files

Thumbs.db
*.log

# 🛠️ Build Files

# 📝 IDE Files

# ==================== WHY THIS MATTERS ====================

# Without this file, you might accidentally upload your API keys

# to GitHub and hackers will steal them in SECONDS!

# This happened to many developers - don’t be one of them!
